          <h2>My First Stitches</h2>
          <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            Like many other young girls, I learned to knit from my grandmother.
            On a whim I finagled my mom into buying a beginner's knitting kit,
            and it fell to my grandmother to actually teach me. She cast on the
            first few stitches and taught me how to do a knit stitch which
            creates a basic garter stitch pattern.

          <h2>Dishcloths > Scarfs</h2>
          <p>
            This is when the inevitable happened; I got bored and stopped. The
            garter stitch is a fundemental skill for beginners, but a scarf
            takes a long time to complete and is very, very boring. A better
            project for absulote beginners is a cotton dishcloth. It is easier
            to try new stitch patterns and techniques on a short project where
            the stakes are low if you mess it up. Plus, you get a much quicker
            dopamine hit for completing something versus slogging along on a
            scarf for ages.

          <h2>Avoiding Ladders</h2>
          <p>
            Another issue crops up if you drop a stitch (meaning you accidently
            drop it from your needles). Unless you address it, a dropped stitch
            will unravel the entire length of your piece. This leaves obvious
            ladders in the finished product. So a very long project for a new
            knitter risks heartbreaking mistakes before they know how to fix a
            dropped stitch. Luckily dropped stitches are fairly easy to fix, but
            I was very glad to have a basic understanding of knitting before I
            attempted to correct one for the first time.
          </p>

              Here are the "ladders" created by a dropped stitch. Can you see
              the stitch/loop near the bottom that you would need to grab to fix
              this?

          <h2>So Squishy</h2>
          <p>
            Hats have been my go-to project as someone that doesn't enjoy long
            slogs. Some people are familiar with ribbing in knitwear, but it has
            variations beyond just knit1, purl1. Fisherman's ribbing effectively
            knits every row twice (and therefore takes longer to knit),
            producing ribbing that is delightlfully squishy, thick, and warm.
            The tradeoff of the extra time spent knitting is offset by how quick
            hats generally are to make and the extra warmth of the finished
            product.

          <h2>Floating with Fair Isle</h2>
          <p>
            Because of my penchant for hats, I looked for other, faster ways to
            make them warm. When knits have more than one color in the same row,
            typically they are using a using a technique called fair isle. While
            traditionally there are only two colors present in each row, there
            is no techinal limit except your own sanity. For each stitch in one
            color, the other color "floats" behind it, creating a dense and cozy
            knit.
          </p>

          <h2>Everything is on YouTube</h2>
          <p>
            YouTube is an irreplaceable resource. There are millions of knitting
            tutorials for everything under the sun. While I don't do projects
            involving particulary esoteric techniques, I have yet to be let down
            by YouTube.

            <figcaption>
              Videos from Purl Soho were specifically recommended by one of my
              pattern books, and this video is how I learned to do a longtail
              cast on which is currently my preferred method.

          <h2>Ravelry is Inevitable</h2>
          <p>
            Most peeople that knit long enough will eventually end up with a
            Ravelry account. It is a database of seemingly every pattern
            published in the past thirty years. Not only does it have extensive
            search funtions and let you purchase individual patterns, Ravelry
            alerts you to any corrections or <q><em>errata</em></q> for a
            pattern. Personally, I find the most useful feature is you can see
            other people's projects if they make them public. This allows you to
            see what the pattern looks like on a regular person in normal
            lighting rather than a model being professionally photographed.
          </p>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>
              Ravelry is invaluable, especially if you are going to make
              something size specific like a sweater where you can read reviews
              and people's adjustments.
